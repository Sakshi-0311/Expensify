Expensify is a Complex Expense Budget Tracker. While building it, I've used many advanced React & JavaScript topics. Some of them are State Management in React, Context API, Local Storage, Material UI, and how to create a scalable React folder structure. But most importantly, I've added voice capabilities to my applications using Speechly. By this feature one can directly add the expenses or savings by just voice commands and can track the expense budget without typing even a single word. 

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
